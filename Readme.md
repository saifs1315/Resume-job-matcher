Online Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)
You can deploy this application for free using Streamlit Community Cloud.

Ensure GitHub Repository is Ready:

Your app.py and requirements.txt files must be committed and pushed to a public GitHub repository.

Securely Add Your API Key:

Do NOT include your GOOGLE_API_KEY directly in your app.py file or secrets.toml within your public GitHub repository.

Go to share.streamlit.io and sign in with your GitHub account.

When deploying your app, or in its settings, navigate to the "Advanced settings" or "Secrets" section.

Click "Add a new secret".

Set the Key as GOOGLE_API_KEY and the Value as your actual Gemini API key. Save this secret.

Deploy the App:

On the Streamlit Community Cloud dashboard, click "New app".

Select your GitHub repository, the correct branch (e.g., main), and the path to your app.py file.

Confirm your GOOGLE_API_KEY is set in the secrets.

Click "Deploy!".

Streamlit Community Cloud will automatically build and host your application, providing you with a public URL. Any future pushes to your selected GitHub branch will automatically update your deployed app.
